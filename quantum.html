									<h3>FACT</h3>
									<p>If we illuminate a quantum dot with UV light, an electron in the QD can be excited and it will change to a state of higher energy!
The excited electron can drop into the valence band relasing its energy by the emission of light.  The color of that light depends on the energy difference between the conductance band and the valence band.</p>
